# Boolean expressions have the same syntax: i < 50, x < y.

# Conditions are similar too:

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")

# Notice that we donâ€™t have parentheses around our expressions, anymore, and that instead of using curly braces, indentation is used to indicate which lines of code belong in which block.

# And elif is the Python keyword that means else if.


# if you wante to write this in C would have write:

if (x < y)
{
	printf("x is less than y\n");
}
else if (x > y)
{
	printf("x is greater than y\n");
}
else
{
	printf("x is equal to y\n");
}

# remember most of these curly braces aren't necessary in C
