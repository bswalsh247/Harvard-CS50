# if we had a foor loop in C that we wanted to say print hello world 50 times

for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++)
{
	printf("hello, world\n");
}

# In Python a loop to do something a certain number of times could be achieved with this:

for i in range(50):
    print("hello, world")

# The variable i is our placeholder again, but we donâ€™t need to declare it, and range(50) 
# automatically creates a range of numbers (from 0 to 49 by default if we ask it for 50 numbers).
