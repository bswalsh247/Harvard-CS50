0. Besides 4 × 4 (which are Game of Fifteen’s dimensions), what other dimensions does the framework allow?
It will be of dimensions d, given by the user where that dimension is less than the games given maximum

int d
    - size of board
    - d <= MAX

#define DIM_MIN 3
#define DIM_MAX 9

1. With what sort of data structure is the game’s board represented?
With a 2D array

int grid [3][3];
grid[0][0]=8;
grid[0][1]=7;
grid[1][2]=6;
grid[1][0]=5;
grid[1][1]=4;
grid[1][2]=3;
grid[2][0]=2;
grid[2][1]=1;
grid[2][2]=???; --> this is an integer grid, we have to put an integer there, but we aren't going to display it
so it's up to me to choose which one makes the most sense to me. 0 or -1, etc.?

2. What function is called to greet the player at game’s start?
greet();
printf

3. What functions do you apparently need to implement?
init
draw
move
won
