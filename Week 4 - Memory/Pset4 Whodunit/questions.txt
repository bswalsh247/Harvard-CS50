1. What’s stdint.h?
    stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18
    to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width
    integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    These are unsigned and signed integer types from stdint.h. Using well-
    defined types makes the code far easier and safer to port since you
    won't get any surprises when one machine interprets int as 16-bit and
    another as 32-bit. What you type is what you get when you use them.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
    DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
    LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    Hex:    0x424d
    ASCII:  BM aka bitmap
    This value is stored in "bfType".


5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfsize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    bisize is the number of bytes required by the structure.

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    biHeight is he height of the bitmap, in pixels. If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB
    and its origin is the lower-left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin
    is the upper-left corner.
    If biHeight is negative, indicating a top-down DIB, biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS.
    Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.
    If biCompression is BI_JPEG or BI_PNG, the biHeight member specifies the height of the decompressed JPEG or
    PNG image file, respectively.
    ---------
    DIB is a graphics file format used by Windows. DIB stands for “Device-Independent Bitmap.”
    DIB files are bitmapped graphics that represent color formats. Similar to .BMP format, except they have a
    different header. DIB files can be opened and edited in most image editing programs.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount The number of bits-per-pixel. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines
    the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
    This member must be one of the following values https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183376(v=vs.85).aspx

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    fopen will return null if it cannot open the file. This can happen if there is not enough memory or the
    file cannot be found or if you don't have permissions.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    The third argument determines the number of elements fread will read.
    So this argument is always 1 because we are always reading one file or one struct at a time.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;

    The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12,
    which is a multiple of 4.

    run this is python interpreter/terminal (4 - (3 * (3)) % 4) % 4 and you get 3

11. What does fseek do?
    Sets your position in the file forward by the offset you specify either from the
    beginning of the file, your current position, or the end of the file, whichever
    you choose.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    SEEK_CUR is an option used in fseek to set the offset relative to the current pointer position.
    Your current position in the file.
